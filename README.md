# fbsnake
A from-scratch(ish) implementation of the classic snake game.

## This is a work-in-progress and is not yet functional!

## What is it?

This is my attempt at writing a basic snake game without the aid of a game engine.
It's probably a terrible idea given that I've never written snake *with* a game engine either, but yolo.

It uses [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb) for window creation and drawing. It also includes some font rendering
code that was shamelessly copied and pasted from one of the examples.
